--1. What is the total amount of petrol in volume sold by every distributer?

A = LOAD 'PetrolData.csv' using PigStorage(',') as (district: chararray, distributer: chararray, buy_rate: chararray, sell_rate: chararray, vol_in: int, vol_out: int, year: int);
B = FOREACH A GENERATE  distributer, vol_out;
C = GROUP B by distributer ;
D = FOREACH C GENERATE group, SUM(B.vol_out);
dump D;


--2. Which are the top 10 distributers ID's for selling petrol? Also display the amount of petrol sold in volume.

SORTBYDIST = ORDER B BY vol_out DESC;
TOP10DIST = LIMIT SORTBYDIST 10;
DUMP TOP10DIST;


--3. List 10 years where consumption of petrol is more with the distributer id who sold it.

SALESCALC = FOREACH A GENERATE distributer, (vol_out * (INT) REPLACE(sell_rate, '([^1-9\\s]+)','')) as sales, year;
SORTBYSALES = ORDER SALESCALC by sales DESC;
TOP10YEAR = LIMIT SORTBYSALES 10;
DUMP TOP10YEAR;


--4. Find the distributer name who sold petrol in least amount.
SORTSALESASC = ORDER SALESCALC by sales ASC;
LESSSALES = LIMIT SORTSALESASC 1;
DUMP LESSSALES;
